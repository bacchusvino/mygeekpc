- Started 2002 (22+ years)
- Based in Idyllwild/Pine Cove, CA — expanding to San Diego (Dec 2024)
- Rates: $80/hr ($60 for seniors)

2. Protects them from losing money
3. Makes their life less confusing

---

## WHAT JOSH ACTUALLY DOES

### Core Tech Support
- Windows & Mac repair
- Computer setup and maintenance
- Bluetooth pairing (cars, devices)
- TV setup and buying advice
- Streaming setup (replacing cable)
- Wi-Fi camera setup (Wyze — no contracts)
- Password manager setup

### Senior Financial Protection (THE DIFFERENTIATOR)

| Problem | Josh's Solution | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Life Alert + landline | Apple Watch setup | Saves $90+/month |
| Cable TV | Streaming setup | Saves $50-150/month |
| Got scammed | Writing letters to banks, dispute help | Recovery |
| Scam calls ("Microsoft calling!") | Education + "Call Josh first" | Prevention |
| ADT/security contracts | Wyze cameras, no monthly fees | Saves $30-60/month |

### Scam Recovery Services
- Documenting what happened
- Writing letters to banks
- Walking through dispute process
- Being their advocate when they're ashamed/overwhelmed

### What Josh Does NOT Want to Do Anymore
- Physical camera installation (ladders, drilling, wiring)

---

## THE AUDIENCE

**Primary:** Seniors (65+) in Idyllwild/Pine Cove and San Diego areas

**Their reality:**
- They don't know there's no one at Google to call
- They believe "Microsoft" is calling them
- They panic when scam popups appear
- They don't know Life Alert requires a landline that costs $90/mo
- They're ashamed after being scammed and don't know how to fight back
- They think they need cable TV
- They're intimidated by their own devices

**The emotional truth:**
They're not stupid. They're overwhelmed. And nobody explains things in plain language without making them feel dumb.

## PHOTOS NEEDED FROM JOSH

Drop these into `/img/work-photos/`:

---

## KEY DIFFERENTIATOR TO EMPHASIZE

**"I write the letters to the banks for you."**

This is huge. Most tech people say "sorry you got scammed." Josh actually helps with recovery — documentation, disputes, advocacy.

That's not tech support. That's **elder advocacy**.

## CALLS TO ACTION

Primary: **Call Josh** (phone number prominent)

Tertiary: **Read the blog** (build trust before they need help)
